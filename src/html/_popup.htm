          <div class="popup__content">

               <div class="popup__text">
                    <p>It is my first job, which I started doing before finishing the course. The main goal was to
                         practice BEM
                         methodology, position, and flex-box.</p>
                    <p>The adaptive header seemed difficult since I didnâ€™t know the
                         elementary JavaScript yet. Therefore, it stayed without a burger menu. I did not change
                         anything in
                         work
                         so that you can see the progress of my knowledge. </p>
                    <p>The second difficult element turned out to be a block with social networks. I tried to place it
                         the
                         right way.
                    </p>

<div id="popup-2" aria-hidden="true" class="popup">

               <button data-close type="button" class="popup__close">Close</button>
               <div class="popup__text">
                    <p>It is the second job. I have already completed courses where I learned about the magic
                         preprocessor
                         and
                         JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>Actually, in this work, I tried to apply them. I did a burger menu, also used forms and anchor
                         links,
                         and studied the property of transition. </p>
                    <p>It turned out to be hard to make the image height
                         adaptive. The solution was in the percentage top padding for the image block.

               <div class="popup__text">
                    <p> It is the third job. The main goal was to learn how to connect video, maps, and a slider to the
                         page.</p>
                    <p> With the help of JavaScript I made a background for a fixed header when scrolling. Did custom
                         video
                         start button and pause when clicking on the video area.</p>
                    <p>Positioning of several blocks made a MacBook in
                         4th section. The hardest thing was to figure out the swiper slider.</p>

                    <p>It is the fourth job. Lots of work with JavaScript and reading documentation.</p>
                    <p>It was hard to make
                         connecting lines in the about us block so that the length of the lines was not dependent on the
                         number
                         of elements and the width of the screen. Numbers for the list elements are assigned
                         independently.</p>
                    <p>First time used a grid. Since I am working based on the gulp and webpack assembly from Yevgen
                         Andrikanych, I
                         did not have to write the logic for spoilers and star rating myself.</p>
