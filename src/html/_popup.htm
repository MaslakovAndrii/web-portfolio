				It is my first job, which I started doing before finishing the course. The main goal was to practice BEM
				methodology, position, and flex-box. The adaptive header seemed difficult since I didnâ€™t know the
				elementary JavaScript yet. Therefore, it stayed without a burger menu. I did not change anything in work
				so that you can see the progress of my knowledge. The second difficult element turned out to be a block
				with social networks. I tried to place it the right way.

				It is the second job. I have already completed courses where I learned about the magic preprocessor and
				JavaScript. Actually, in this work, I tried to apply them. I did a burger menu, also used forms and
				anchor links, and studied the property of transition. It turned out to be hard to make the image height
				adaptive. The solution was in the percentage top padding for the image block.

				It is the third job. The main goal was to learn how to connect video, maps, and a slider to the page.
				With the help of JavaScript I made a background for a fixed header when scrolling. Did custom video
				start button and pause when clicking on the video area. Positioning of several blocks made a MacBook in
				4th section. The hardest thing was to figure out the swiper slider.

				It is the fourth job. Lots of work with JavaScript and reading documentation. It was hard to make
				connecting lines in the about us block so that the length of the lines was not dependent on the number
				of elements and the width of the screen. Numbers for the list elements are assigned independently. First
				time used a grid. Since I am working based on the gulp and webpack assembly from Yevgen Andrikanych, I
				did not have to write the logic for spoilers and star rating myself.
